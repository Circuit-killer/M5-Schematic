# Schematic difference

*This document will introduct the difference between those m5cores(i.e. M5Core Basic(the Black one), M5Core GRAY, M5Fire(the Red one), M5Core WHITE)*

Currently, we have 4 kinds of M5Cores and one minicore(*named M5Stick*). They are simliar to each other.

**Be careful, the early version of M5Fire was built in MPU6050 + MAG3110, but we change MPU6050 + MAG3110 to MPU9250.**

*IIC Address*

*MPU9250: 0x68*

*IP5360:  0x0E*
